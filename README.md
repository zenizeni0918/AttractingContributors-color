# What is OpenWorldGame
A genre that has increased due to the evolution of game machines. In contrast to the open world game, the game called the box garden type is divided into sections with stages, and loading time is required to move between sections. In the open world game, the play stage becomes one big map, so there is no need to load when moving between areas, and the player can move around freely.
